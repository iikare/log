# logq
a simple variadic logger

# build
to run the demonstration program, simply compile the test binary with `make test`.


# usage

for usage in a project, two steps need to occur:

1. include `log.h` wherever needed  
2. ensure your compiler compiles `log.cc`


then, simply use the logger as described in the demonstration program.

this logger requires `C++11` or higher.
